## Introduction
Practicing pitching baseballs can be hard because getting immediate feedback is hard. Our ball tracker is here to help!

Unlike any commercially available alternatives, which are extremely expensive, hard to set up, and require several cameras, the ball tracker produces accurate estimates of the pitch velocity and the strike zone using only a single camera and a laptop.

It is built for sports lovers and recreational players, but even professionals can use it. With a laptop and a decent camera, the ball tracker can give you a quality training session anytime, anywhere.

## Technical Highlights
**It's accurate!** The ball tracker adopts multiple state-of-the-art tracking algorithms and fuses the measurements with a [Baysian probabilistic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability). It can deliver incredible tracking accuracy even with a low-cost camera.

**It's fast!** The ball tracker is programmed with [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) which harnesses the ultimate parallel processing power of the GPU. It outruns any balls, guaranteed.

**It's fun!** The graphics is implemented with [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) which delivers a native, clean, and professional look and feel. Together with sophisticated error handling, the software is more accessible, more robust, and more fun to use than ever - it just does not crash its beautiful interface on any rubbish input and keeps the practice going all day.
