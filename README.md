# Original Content

Practicing pitching baseballs can be hard because getting immediate feedback is hard. Our ball tracker is here to help!

Commercially available alternatives are extremely expensive, hard to set up, and require several cameras. Our ball tracker produces accurate estimates of the pitch velocity and strike zone using only a single camera and a laptop.

This program was designed With sports lovers and recreational players in mind, but even professionals can use it. With just a laptop and a decent camera, our ball tracker can give you a quality training session anytime, anywhere.

## Technical Highlights
**It's accurate!** The ball tracker adopts multiple state-of-the-art tracking algorithms and fuses the measurements with a [Baysian probabilistic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability). It can deliver incredible tracking accuracy even with a low-cost camera.

**It's fast!** The ball tracker is programmed with [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) which harnesses the ultimate parallel processing power of the GPU. It outruns any balls, guaranteed.

**It's fun!** The graphics is implemented with [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) which delivers a native, clean, and professional look and feel. Together with sophisticated error handling, the software is more accessible, more robust, and more fun to use than ever - it just does not crash its beautiful interface on any rubbish input and keeps the practice going all day.
